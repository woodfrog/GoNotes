## Overall Idea
1. Go has a single workspace for all the Go projects on the machine, which is totally different from almost all other languages. $HOME/go for example. Go tools will build based on the source codes at $HOME/go/src and generate corresponding command executable or package files in $HOME/go/bin or $HOME/go/pkg. 

2. Go is invented for building huge system like servers. It make the build process easier.

## Control flow

1. C's while loop is spelled for loop in Go, i.e. only the middle part of the three expressions remains. 


3. In Go's for and if statement, () is not needed but {} is always required and cannot be omitted.

4. 	Switch without a condition is the same as switch true. This construct can be a clean way to write long if-then-else chains.

5. **deferred function**. They are pushed into a stack.
